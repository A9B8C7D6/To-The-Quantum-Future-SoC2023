# Week 0

In this week, we will cover the Math and Quantum Physics required for the remaining duration. The Math section will comprise almost entirely of Linear Algebra, which will include a lot of what has been covered in MA106, but also quite a few new notations and ideas, such as **Outer Products**, **Tensor Products** and **Polar and Singular Value Decompositions**. The Quantum Physics part will mostly focus on **Evolution** and **Measurements** of quantum states.

We'll use the book Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Michael Nielson and Isaac Chuang (abbreviated as QCQI) as our primary reference.

The reading material for the week is Sections 2.1 and 2.2 from QCQI : (Linear Algebra and Postulates of Quantum Mechanics)

The assignment for this week is up :)

# To-The-Quantum-Future-SoC2023
Repository for "To The Quantum Future" as a part of WnCC Seasons of Code '23. Mentors : [Ameya Prashant Deshmukh](https://github.com/Woolverine563),  [Krishna Narasimhan Agaram](https://github.com/mathismusic) and [Anand Narasimhan](https://github.com/A9B8C7D6)

----------------------------------

## Overview

The first month of the project will be an introduction to Quantum Computing :atom: . We will be primarily following the book "Quantum Computation and Quantum Information" by Nielsen and Chuang, along with other references. Along the way, we'll be creating quantum circuits using IBM's qiskit package embedded in Python and also implementing various quantum algorithms using the same.

The mentees will be given a choice among one of the following : Quantum Cryptography, Quantum Information and Error Correction, and Quantum Machine Learning. This would begin with an introduction to their classical counterparts, before moving on to Quantum-based papers. This will be heavily dependent on the mentee's prior knowledge, as well as the pace at which they are comfortable with proceeding at.

## Review Procedure

The mentees will be required to submit code/solutions to weekly assignments that we prepare. They will be maintaining separate repos for the project, with a similar directory structure to this repo.

## Feedback

Feedback will be taken through the WhatsApp group

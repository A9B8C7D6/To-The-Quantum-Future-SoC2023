    "So computing the measurement statistics of the measurement ${M_m}_m$ reduces to computing the expectation values in projective measurements of the $E_m$ s. How might we do this? For starters, if $E_m$ was diagonalizable in the computational basis, then we are more or less done - we must just create a huge ensemble of states in $\\rho$, measure them in the comp. basis, collect the empirical probabilities of each outcome and compute the expectation of $E_m$. But what is some $E_m$ is not diagonal in the computational basis? Well, that's trivial, measure them in that basis! - The issue here, is that measuring in the computational basis is \"easy\", but not so to measure in an arbitrary basis. We use the change of basis trick to turn the basis $|a_i\\rangle$ of $E_m$ into the computational basis by applying to $\\rho$ the unitary $U = \\sum_i |i\\rangle\\langle a_i|$. Convince yourself that measuring the new state in the computational basis gives you identical statistics as measuring the original state in the basis $|a_i\\rangle$. There you go - by modifying the state via a unitary, we can measure any $E_m$. Let's implement this in Qiskit below:"

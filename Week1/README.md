# Week 1

We start this week with an application of entanglement to transmit classical information via qubits.

We then introduce a new framework to represent Quantum systems - The Density Operator. This has its power for mixed states and open systems in particular.

We finish off with an intro to Quantum Computing, explaining why we're going *to the Quantum Future* (wink, parallelism) with some algorithms that exploit quantum parallelism.

The reading material for the week is :

  - Section 2.3 (Superdense Coding)
  - Sections 2.4 and 2.5 (Density Matrices, Schmidt Decomposition and Purification)
  - Sections 1.3 and 1.4 (Intro to Quantum Computing)
  
Along with this, we'll start to work with **Qiskit** this week, which is an open-source Python SDK for Quantum Computation.

Assignment 1 coming up in a few days :) (Took like few weeks ig, sorry :( )

There are 4 questions this week, with the topics being Super Dense Encoding, Quantum Teleportation, POVMs and Operators in general. The instructions for each question are in the respective files, so go ahead with them!

<!-- In this week, we will cover the Math and Quantum Physics required for the remaining duration. The Math section will comprise almost entirely of Linear Algebra, which will include a lot of what has been covered in MA106, but also quite a few new notations and ideas, such as **Outer Products**, **Tensor Products** and **Polar and Singular Value Decompositions**. The Quantum Physics part will mostly focus on **Evolution** and **Measurements** of quantum states.

We'll use the book Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Michael Nielson and Isaac Chuang (abbreviated as QCQI) as our primary reference.

The reading material for the week is Sections 2.1 and 2.2 from QCQI : (Linear Algebra and Postulates of Quantum Mechanics)

The assignment for this week is up :) -->

# Week 3 - Algorithms

This week we turn to some famous quantum algorithms, with the knowledge of quantum computation and circuits that we have so far studied. We conclude with a tiny look at how real quantum computers are built. Relevant parts of QCQI are:

- Sections 5.1-5.3
- Section 6.1 (optional: sections 6.2-6.3)
- Sections 7.1-7.3 (optional: rest of Chapter 7)

Next week, you have a choice of continuation: Quantum Cryptography, Quantum ML and Quantum Error-Correction.

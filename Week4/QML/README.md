# Quantum Machine Learning

If you have a basic understanding of what ML is about, then you're good to go! We'll be looking at Quantum ML (in the limited time we have) and using demos on PennyLane to understand what its all about.

PennyLane is a framework that we use for Quantum Machine Learning, not too dissimilar to Qiskit as in you should be able to understand the syntax by looking at a few demos.

Look at [the official site](https://pennylane.ai/) for instructions on how to install it.

We'll start with the [Hello World of Quantum ML](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qubit_rotation), which is optimising a sequence of 2 rotation gates to act as an equivalent for the CNOT gate. This will hopefully get you up to speed with PennyLane and also the common things wrt to optimising parameters of quantum functions.

After this, there are several demos (of papers in QML) that you can explore. If you're interested in Quantum Chemistry, you can look at [this paper on Variational Quantum Eigensolvers](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_vqe) and if further interested, look at [this tutorial on molecular Hamiltonians](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quantum_chemistry).

[This demo](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_data_reuploading_classifier) talks about building a classifier using a single qubit quantum circuit.

If you have any prior experience in using GANs, you could look at [this paper](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quantum_gans)

Short story, you could look at any of the demos [here](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demonstrations/quantum-machine-learning) and see if they interest you, and read through one of them, understand it and play around with its parameters, etc. and see if you could even modify things perhaps :)

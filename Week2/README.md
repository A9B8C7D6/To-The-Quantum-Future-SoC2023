# Week 2

This week, we start with Quantum Circuits (properly). We go through Chapter 4 in QCQI, going through single qubit operations, followed by operations on multiple gates, expanding into controlled gates. We then briefly move on to measurement, and stop at Section 4.5, which covers the universality of all  quantum gates using only single qubit and CNOT gates.

The reading portion for this week is Chapter 4, upto Section 4.5.4. Enjoy!
